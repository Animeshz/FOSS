# Git Branches & Forks

## Branches

<!--

Fundamentals

Repository is a series of commits (cuz chain - dependent nodes).
Repository has branches (& tags) which are actually series of commits.

Commits only withhold its changes and exactly 1 parent, it doesn't internally hold state of repository (not a zip)
  = repository's state can be accessed by refs: branch and HEAD and hash

## Conflicts - Merge & Rebase based resolution

Rebase rewrites history: Grandfather paradox
